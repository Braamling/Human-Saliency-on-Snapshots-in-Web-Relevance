\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced \datasetname, an out-of-the-box dataset for research on both content and visual web page \ac{LTR}. The experiments show that using state-of-the-art visual extraction methods can have a significant performance improvement compared to using only content features.

\todo{should we keep the following lines about masks in?} During this study we also explored using the highlights separate from the screenshots. However, this did not produce results worth mentioning. The dataset with separate highlights is available upon request.

Future work should explore other visual extraction methods and combinations with well-known \ac{LTR} models. More qualitative work on visual features could provide proof useful for improving visual \ac{LTR} even further and potentially give new insights in good web design patterns.
