\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experiments}
In this section, we discuss the setup of the experiments performed on \datasetname. The experiments are set out to demonstrate the abilities of visual features in LTR and set a baseline for future visual LTR research.
%All PyTorch experiments were performed on a GTX 1080 Ti with 11gb of RAM. Preproccessing was performed on a Thinkpad X250 with an Intel i5-5300U CPU and 16gb of ram.

\paragraph{Benchmarking content features}
\todo{In fact, this should go into discussion and not experimental setup and/or experiments. But let's do this later.}
In \ac{LTR} research, the amount and type of content features used for training varies widely per dataset and study.
To assess the performance of the 11 content features used in this study (see Table~\ref{tab:setdescription}), we use a set of known LTR algorithms on the million query track 2007 (MQ2007)\todo{footnote or ref} with the LETOR 4.0\footnote{\url{TODO}} content features.
MQ2007 and LETOR 4.0 have a total of 46 features containing all 11 features from Table~\ref{tab:setdescription}.
The experiment use the RankLib\footnote{https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/RankLib/} implementations of RankBoost, AdaRank and LambdaMart on both 46 and 11 features using their default settings.

\paragraph{\ac{LTR} with visual features}
The experiments on \ac{LTR} with visual features are run five times for each of the five folds. \todo{Why? Due to random initialization?}
Each run is performed using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 100 using a learning rate of $0.0001$ and $0.00005$ for the ViP and VGG-16 models respectively.
\todo{Why these values?}
Within each fold, the results for all five runs are averaged to create one measurement per fold per query.
